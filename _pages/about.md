My name is Jesper Hald and I have been working as a Cloud Architect specializing in Azure since 2016.

I started out in the late 1990s, studying to become a robotics engineer, but changed direction into Microsoft infrastructure in the early 00s.

My interests have always been new technology - as much as possible - which is why the pace of changes being introduced into the hyperscaling cloud platforms suits me perfectly.

I am currently working as an Azure Architect/Consultant based in Denmark - doing advisory, with a lot of engineering thrown in on the side, for customers in the danish enterprise segment. Occasionally I am also facilitating workshops and presenting special topics as a speaker.

My scribblings on these pages are primarily based on personal experiences and observations made, while working with Cloud technologies for customers, as well as some more explorative writings on speciel topics of interest.
